# Frost

**Frost** is a modern systems programming language that combines the speed of C
with modern language features. It offers static typing and compiles to
[LLVM IR](https://llvm.org/docs/LangRef.html), delivering high performance while
remaining accessible and easy to learn. Whether you're building system tools or
performance-critical applications, Frost provides the low-level control you need
with the convenience of contemporary programming practices.

## Features

- **Static Typing**: Catch type errors at compile time, improving safety and
  efficiency.
- **LLVM Backend**: Generates optimized code, leveraging the powerful LLVM
  ecosystem.
- **Low-Level Control**: Access hardware resources and memory directly, similar
  to C/C++.
- **Modern Syntax**: Designed to be more readable and maintainable compared to
  traditional low-level languages.

## Getting Started

To get started with Frost, download the latest release from the
[releases page](README.md) or build from source. You will need to have
[Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) and [LLVM 19](https://llvm.org/) or newer
installed on your system.

## Examples

For examples and sample code, check the [examples](examples) directory. These
demonstrate the key features of the language, including basic syntax, data
structures, and how to interact with the system.
